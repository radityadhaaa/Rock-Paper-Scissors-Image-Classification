# Image Classification Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Description
This project aims to build an image classification model using the *rockpaperscissors* dataset. The model will be trained to recognize three classes: **paper**, **rock**, and **scissors**.

## Key Steps
1. **Download Dataset**  
   The dataset is downloaded from the following URL:  
   [https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip)

2. **Extract Dataset**  
   The downloaded dataset is extracted using `unzip`.

3. **Train the Model**  
   The dataset is used to train an image classification model using **TensorFlow/Keras**.

4. **Evaluate the Model**  
   The model is evaluated to measure accuracy and performance on validation data.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.6
- TensorFlow >= 2.0
- Supporting Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
